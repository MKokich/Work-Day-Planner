# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this project I created a week day scheduler with the hours of 9am to 5pm for scheduling. With this application, the user can see which hour of the day they are in, marked with red, the past hours with gray and future hours with green. As the current hours change, the colors will change appropriately, signifying time passing. From there they can simply type in a task, press the save button on the right side of the page, and when they refresh the page, their task will be saved to their planner. 

## Installation
