# Work Day Planner

## Description

For this project I created a week day planner with the hours of 9am to 5pm for scheduling. With this application, the user can see which hour of the day they are in, marked with red, the past hours with gray and future hours with green. From there they can simply type in a task, press the save button on the right side of the page, and when they refresh the page, their task will be saved to their planner. As the current hours change, the colors will change appropriately, signifying time passing.

# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project allows the user to play a 3 question timed code quiz. When the start button is clicked, a timer will start and provide the user with the first question. After an answer is selected, a "correct" or "wrong" alert will occur, and user will be presented with the next question. When all questions are answered, user is alerted with game over and timer will stop.

This project was challenging for me but functions as I wanted it to. The application can be altered even further to portray scores and loss time for incorrect answers. I look forward to building out more javascript applications and furthuring my skills.
